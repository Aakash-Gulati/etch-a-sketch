# etch-a-sketch
Description:
- Project delivering a basic kids toy in a HTML, CSS and js format. Made it dynamic/interactive with DOM manipulations. This will be polished overtime. For now it's just a bare bone project but for me it's a milestone closer to mastering the art of frontend.

Skills acquired:
    - DOM manipulations.
    - Nested loops.
